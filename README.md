# OVERVIEW ðŸ“š
* This project uses a Bidirectional LSTM model and numerous machine learning models such as Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and KNN to classify a person's gender (M/F) based on his/her first name. 
* The dataset used consists of 95,025 first names and their corresponding gender.
* Bidirectional LSTM performed best (95% accuracy on train data, 91% accuracy on validation data, 91% accuracy on test data).
* Key Tools & Technologies Used - TensorFlow, Keras, scikit-learn, Flask, HTML, CSS.
